## ✨ Features

-   **Multiple File Upload:** Drag and drop multiple `.txt` files for comparison.
-   **Dual Analysis Methods:**
    -   **Sentence-BERT (Advanced):** Uses deep learning to understand the semantic meaning of the text, making it excellent at detecting paraphrased content.
    -   **TF-IDF (Classic):** A traditional keyword-based statistical method, effective for finding direct copy-paste plagiarism.
-   **Interactive Dashboard:** A clean UI to visualize the analysis results.
-   **Key Metrics Summary:** At-a-glance view of the most important statistics, including total pairs compared, pairs above the threshold, highest similarity, and average similarity.
-   **Rich Visualizations:**
    -   Bar chart showing the most similar pairs of documents.
    -   Histogram displaying the distribution of similarity scores.
    -   Grouped bar chart for per-document analysis, showing the maximum and average similarity for each file.
-   **Downloadable Reports:** Export the full similarity report to a CSV file for further analysis or record-keeping.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer
-   `pip` package manager

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/barshal-horse/Plagarism-detection-using-NLP.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Plagarism-detection-using-NLP
    ```

3.  **(Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    -   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   **macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### How to Run the Application

1.  **Run the Streamlit app from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    *If the command above doesn't work due to PATH issues, use this alternative:*
    ```bash
    python -m streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  Use the sidebar to upload your `.txt` files, select an analysis method, set the threshold, and click "Analyze Documents" to see the dashboard.
